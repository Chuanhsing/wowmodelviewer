   A good point to start is using a recent CVS version of mpq-tools.
   and trying to use it with every mpq archive you could get :)

Q: Can you give a small example to demonstrate the usage?
A: Of course :-) The example below takes first parameter
   as mpq archive and extracts first file from it.

   /*
    *  Compile with:
    *
    *  gcc mpq-example.c -o mpq-example -lmpq -I/usr/local/include/libmpq
    */

   #include <linux/limits.h>
   #include "libmpq/mpq.h"

   int main(int argc, char **argv) {
           char listfile[PATH_MAX] = "/usr/local/share/libmpq/db/diablo2/setup.mpq.conf"
           mpq_archive *mpq_a;

           mpq_a = malloc(sizeof(mpq_archive));
           memset(mpq_a, 0, sizeof(mpq_archive));

           libmpq_archive_open(mpq_a, argv[1]);
           libmpq_listfile_open(mpq_a, listfile);
           libmpq_file_extract(mpq_a, 1);
           libmpq_archive_close(mpq_a);

           free(mpq_a);
   }
