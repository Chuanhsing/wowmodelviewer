= Introduction =
The WoW Model Viewer is a stand-alone program that reads the data files that are included with the game, "World of Warcraft".  This program allows you to view models from the game, and does its best to try and replicate and emulate the models to look just as they would in-game.  What this program does NOT do, is allow you to "import" the characters you design into the game.  That is not what this program is about. This program does not interact with the game at all apart from reading in the data files.  If you are looking for a way to "model change", then this is not the program for you.

The program allows you to view characters and to equip them with items, also allowing you to see them performing animations, can view any creature that exists within the game using any of their various textures, as well as seeing some of the underlying detail such as their skeletal system. Support was also added for being able to customize the lighting conditions in an attempt to allow the users, particularly Machinima makers, to improve the lighting conditions to help blend the models with background scenes.

=How to get the source to compile=

==On Mac OS X==

Building the Mac app? Go [MacOSXCompilation here].

==On Windows==
Some of the work is already done for users of Visual Studio 2008. Check [Home#Uncommon_Events Uncommon Events] if you are using Visual Studio 2005/2010 or another compiler.

=== Common Events ===
Everyone needs to do the following:
====Download and install wxWidgets 2.8.10====
 # Get wxMSW - installer for Windows(wxMSW-2.8.10-Setup.exe) from [http://www.wxwidgets.org/downloads/ the wxWidgets Website].
 # Install wxMSW-2.8.10-Setup.exe to C:\wxWidgets-2.8.10\
 # Use Visual Studio 2008 to open wxWidgets-2.8.10\build\msw\wx.dsw and build a Debug & Release version.
====64-Bit====
If you are building a 64-bit version of WoW Model Viewer, you also need to do the following:
 # Add a 64-bit Configuration. (May not be needed if you get wxWidgets 2.9.0, but that version has not yet been tested.)
 # Build 64-bit Release & Debug versions.

====WoWModelViewer====
If you need a Subversion program, I recommend [http://tortoisesvn.net/ TortoiseSVN] for Windows users, or you can try one of the ones [http://subversion.apache.org/packages.html listed here].
 # Get wowmodelviewer from [http://code.google.com/p/wowmodelviewer/source/checkout here]. Please refer to your Subversion software's documentation on how to checkout (download) the source code listed on the checkout page.
 # Use Visual Studio 2008 to open wowmodelviewer-read-only\src\wowmodelview.sln

Congratulations! You should have successfully loaded WMV's source code!

=== Uncommon Events ===
If you are building on Visual Studio 2005 or 2010, or you are not using Visual Studio, you will also need to do the following:
====Build CxImage Libraries====
 # Get cximage600_full.7z from http://www.xdp.it/cximage.htm
 # Extract the files to C:\cximage600_full and use Visual Studio to open CxImgLib.dsw. Build a release and a debug version.
 # copy bin\cximagecrt.dll & bin\cximagecrtd.dll to wowmodelviewer-read-only\bin_support\Windows\32bit.
 # copy CxImage\CxImageDLL\Debug\cximagecrtd.lib & CxImage\CxImageDLL\Release\cximagecrt.lib to wowmodelviewer-read-only\src\lib\Windows\32bit.
====64-Bit====
 # Add a configuration for 64-bits to all the projects within the CxImgLib solution. (This will take some time.) I recommend sending the binary information to a new directory, specifically for 64bits. (bin64, Release64 & Debug64 for example.)
 # Compile 64-bit Release & Debug versions.
 # copy bin64\cximagecrt.dll & bin64\cximagecrtd.dll to wowmodelviewer-read-only\bin_support\Windows\64bit.
 # copy CxImage\CxImageDLL\Debug64\cximagecrtd.lib & CxImage\CxImageDLL\Release64\cximagecrt.lib to wowmodelviewer-read-only\src\lib\Windows\64bit.

====Build Glew Libraries====
 # Download the Glew Source from [http://glew.sourceforge.net/ here]. Unzip the files to C:\Glew-1.5.3
 # Open C:\glew-1.5.3\build\vc6\glew.dsw
 # Compile Release and Debug versions.
 # Copy bin\glew32.dll & bin\glew32d.dll to wowmodelviewer-read-only\bin_support\Windows\32bit.
 # Copy lib\glew32.lib, glew32d.lib & glew32s.lib to wowmodelviewer-read-only\src\lib\Windows\32bit
====64-Bit====
 # Add a configuration for 64-bits to at least the Glew and Glew_Shared projects.
 # Compile 64-bit Release & Debug versions.
 # Copy bin64\glew32.dll & bin64\glew32d.dll to wowmodelviewer-read-only\bin_support\Windows\64bit.
 # Copy lib64\glew32.lib, glew32d.lib & glew32s.lib to wowmodelviewer-read-only\src\lib\Windows\64bit.
