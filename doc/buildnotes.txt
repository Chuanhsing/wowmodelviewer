/*
WoW model viewer uses
wxWidgets(2.8.0), OpenGL, zlib, CxImage(5.99c), MPQLib, DDSLib, GLEW(1.3.3)

You MUST have those libs to be able to compile.   OpenGL libs should come with Visual C++, 
if it doesn't then you will need to download the Windows Platform SDK.
So first compile wxWidgets lib. You will also need to compile CxImage lib/dll. 

If you don't know where to get them,  just google for them.  Most likely the very first result is the
one you want.

Once you have all these libs/dll's compiled,  you will need to make sure that their Header Include paths
and Lib paths have been added to the project path list.

As for the program "flow",  it all starts with App.cpp,  these initiates the program using
wxWidgets to handle all events, etc.  Once the program has initiated it will then create a
window frame, this being "modelviewer.cpp".   So essentially The flow could be read as something like...

App.cpp		---> Modelviewer.cpp	--->	Modelcanvas.cpp		--->	model.cpp			---> Particle.cpp
																--->	wmo.cpp
									--->	Modelcontrol.cpp
									--->	Modelexport.cpp
									--->	AnimExporter.cpp
									--->	lightcontrol.cpp
									--->	Animcontrol.cpp
									--->	charcontrol.cpp
									--->	database.cpp		--->	mpq_libmpq.cpp
																--->	dbcfile.cpp
			---> Video.cpp			--->	ddslib.cpp
			---> util.cpp
			
Of course it isn't 'exactly' like that since a lot of the controls/objects interlink with each other, 
but you get the idea.

Its a bit of a mess... actually thats an understatement, but thats to be expected when there
wasn't any actual program design.  Instead it used and relied on the "evolutionary design process".
