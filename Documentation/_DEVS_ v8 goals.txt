===============================================================
  Goals for WoW Model Viewer V0.8.0.0 (Or, WMV v8 for short.)
===============================================================

These are goals we need to aim at for the first v8 release. Primary goals are things we need to consider while we're rebuilding the core system. This is the stuff we should be focusing on. Secondary goals are less important, but are still needed for our first release. Future goals are things to add or fix at some point in the current, or a future development cycle, but aren't necessary for the first release of v8.

===============================
PRIMARY GOALS:
===============================
- Rewrite WMV from the ground up, using the Qt Framework.
- Make WMV completely backwards compatible. IE: Able to load data from any WoW version.
- Add Multiple "Modes" that WMV can operate in. Defaults to classic "Viewer" mode.
- Add a Cinema Mode that changes WMV into more of a Machinima tool, and changes the main Viewer into a Camera with controls.
- Redesign internal classes to help with forwards/backwards Compatibility issues, Displaying, and Exporting the model.
- Allow for the display of multiple M2 models at once, including placement controls, and animation instance controllers.
- Redesign the UI for better space usage, better controls, and better displaying of visual data.
- Fix many of the long-standing display issues. (Alpha-Channel issues, Lack of Reflections/Specularity, etc.)
- Add full ADT support, including the optional displaying of WMOs and M2s listed in that ADT.
- Change our item lists to use DBC files, instead of CSV files. Or, alternatly, WMV builds the CSV files automatically. CSV files will still be used for custom user-items.


===============================
SECONDARY GOALS:
===============================
- Functionality when browsing items, to add them to the equipable items list.
- Add a "Scripter" to the Cinema Mode. Lets the user play a list of animations with custom animation settings.
- Allow Scripter to load and play an audio file to script animation to.
- Allow Scripter to animate Model position and rotation.
- Allow Scripter to animate the Camera's/Viewer's position and rotation.
- Fix many of the Cross-Platform issues.


===============================
FUTURE GOALS:
===============================
- Update all the exporters to take full advantage of that format's capabilities.
- Add Collada Exporter.
- Cross-Platform Video Export, including Alpha-Channel support.
- Unify many of the reduntant, and common functions.
