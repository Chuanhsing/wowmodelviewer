Minimum changes to make the solution build without needing extra
configuration in Visual Studio Express 2008 with Windows Platform SDK
on my Win XP box. Hoping that others will find Debug and Release
configs build out the box also.

Could be much cleaner - builds slow because of poor #includes and no
pre-compiled headers, still has build warnings, contains unnecessary
projects, configs, and some prebuilt binaries - but one step at a time.

Changes performed:

Updated old dsps and existing vcproj's to MSVC9.0,
and bundled them into the main solution.

animcontrol.cpp, charcontrol.cpp:
A few grotty casts to std::string. Have a feeling these should not
be needed and that wxString is not being built quite right.
charcontrol.h:
Can't compare wxString with 0 - use operator(!) instead.

OpenGLHeaders.h:
Removed unused GL aux and extensions. The former is deprecated from
at least MSVC8.0 and the libs are no longer supplied.
app.h
Similar changes to link correct glew libs rather than gl aux.

modelbankcontrol.h:
Added missing #include of <vector>

util.cpp:
#include wx/msw/winundef.h to avoid macro clash with CreateDialog.

Also attempted to add sufficient svn:ignores to cover build artifacts
etc. This included svn rm of some build dirs too, should know if it
worked properly following commit.
